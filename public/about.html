<h1>About Me:</h1>
<p>AMOR FATI, this is my favorite quote from stiocism. In life we should always appreciate in what's 
  happening to us, in every second, minutes, hours, days and year. We cannot control the events but we can control 
  the outcome. This is how I live my life always learning, success is always the far side of failure, learn from it
  and keep improving. </p>

<p>I am a Triathlete and at the same time a Web Page Developer.</p>

<p>I love my family. Our goal, together with my Wife Rusette and our kids is to experience what is life. 
  We live to Travel to experience different cultures and meet good friends. We live to eat delicious food.
  We will create beautiful moments. Life is not easy but is worth the grind together with my family.</p>
